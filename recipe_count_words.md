# {{PROBLEM}} Function Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a writer 
I want to know the number of words in a given sentence
So I can see how long it is

## 2. Design the Function Signature

_Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```python
# EXAMPLE

def count_words(sentence):
    """Returns the number of words in a string

    Parameters: (list all parameters and their types)
        sentence: a string that is a sentence containing multiple words (e.g. "Today I went to work and spoke to my colleague about xyz.")

    Returns: (state the return value and its type)
        an integer that is the number of words in the given string

    Side effects: (state any side effects)
        no side effects
    """
    pass # Test-driving means _not_ writing any code here yet.
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a sentence of 3 words
It returns 3
"""
count_words("Let's go party") => 3

"""
Given a sentence of 25 words including punctuation
It returns the full sentence of 25 words
"""
count_words("Today I went to the shop and bought 5 things: a bunch of grapes, some greek yoghurt, blueberries, a jar of honey, and some granola.") => 25

"""
Given an empty string
It returns 0
"""
count_words("") => 0

"""
Given a string of numbers
It returns 0
"""
count_words("547 1224 988") => 0

"""
Given a string of numbers and words
It returns the correct number of words without numbers included
"""
count_words("547 and 1224 or 988") => 2

"""
Given a string of special characters
It returns 0
"""
count_words("@Â£$ &*$ !!!") => 0

"""
Given a sentence that contains special characters as words
Returns the correct result without including the special character words in the count
"""
count_words("Today I went to work and handed in a project !!!") => 10



"""
Given an input of None
It throws an error with the message "Error: No input given."
"""
extract_uppercase(None) => "Error: No input given."
```
_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._


## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

Here's an example for you to start with:

```python
# EXAMPLE

from lib.extract_uppercase import *

"""
Given a lower and an uppercase word
It returns a list with the uppercase word
"""
def test_extract_uppercase_with_upper_then_lower():
    result = extract_uppercase("hello WORLD")
    assert result == ["WORLD"]
```

Ensure all test function names are unique, otherwise pytest will ignore them!
